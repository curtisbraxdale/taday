# Taday API

**Taday** is a modern RESTful API backend for a productivity web app that delivers daily agendas to users via SMS. Built with Go, PostgreSQL, and Fly.io deployment, the backend features secure authentication, user management, scheduling, tagging, and token-based authorization using HTTP-only cookies.

## üöÄ Features

* **JWT-based Authentication** with Refresh Tokens
* **Secure Login, Registration, and Logout Flows**
* **Persistent Cookie-based Sessions** (HTTP-only, `SameSite=None`, `Secure`)
* **CRUD operations for:**

  * Users
  * Todos (day-based tasks)
  * Events (calendar blocks with recurrence)
  * Tags (labeling for events)
* **Event-Tag Relationships** (many-to-many)
* **Fly.io Deployment** (production-ready Docker container)

## üõ° Authentication

The API uses a combination of access and refresh JWTs:

* **Access Token**: Short-lived (1 hour), stored in an HTTP-only cookie
* **Refresh Token**: Long-lived (60 days), stored in HTTP-only cookie and validated against DB

### Endpoints

* `POST /api/login` ‚Äî sets `access_token` and `refresh_token` cookies on success
* `POST /api/logout` ‚Äî clears both cookies and revokes token in DB
* `POST /api/refresh` ‚Äî validates refresh token and issues a new access token

All cookies are:

* `HttpOnly`
* `Secure`
* `SameSite=None`

> ‚úÖ Compatible with cross-site frontends like `https://taday.io`

## üß© Frontend Integration

The frontend is hosted on [`https://taday.io`](https://taday.io). It communicates with this API by including credentials in fetch calls:

```ts
fetch("https://taday-api.fly.dev/api/users", {
  method: "GET",
  credentials: "include",
});
```

This ensures cookies (access & refresh tokens) are sent and handled securely across domains.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup (Dev)

1. **Start PostgreSQL** (or use a Fly.io volume)
2. **Run migrations** with `sqlc`
3. **Build the Go server**

```bash
go run ./cmd/api
```

---

## üì¶ Deployment

App is deployed to Fly.io using Docker. On login, cookies are set with production flags:

* `Secure: true`
* `SameSite=None`
* `HttpOnly: true`

TLS termination is handled by Fly.io.
