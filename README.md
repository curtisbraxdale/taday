# Taday API

**Taday** is a modern RESTful API backend for a productivity web app that delivers daily agendas to users via SMS. Built with Go, PostgreSQL, and Fly.io deployment, the backend features secure authentication, user management, scheduling, tagging, and token-based authorization using HTTP-only cookies.

I built this web app because I have gotten into the digital-minimalist / dumbphone community. As such I try to have as few applications and as little-to-no notifications on my phone. I wanted to be able to stay productive and be reminded of my tasks and events without feeling like I was constantly reaching for my phone again and again. I still have text and call notifications enabled on my phone for emergencies and that's when the idea popped in my head. I could send myself a daily agenda via sms to my phone every morning at 8:00 am, in it there would be events that I had scheduled for the day and some todos that I had logged. This might seem like a regression in technology but for someone like me trying to reduce their screen-time as much as possible I thought that this would be a good use-case for a web app like mind. No app required, no persistent notifications. Just one daily text with the information that you have created and asked for.

## 🛡 Authentication

The API uses a combination of access and refresh JWTs:

* **Access Token**: Short-lived (1 hour), stored in an HTTP-only cookie
* **Refresh Token**: Long-lived (60 days), stored in HTTP-only cookie and validated against DB

### Endpoints

* `POST /api/login` — sets `access_token` and `refresh_token` cookies on success
* `POST /api/logout` — clears both cookies and revokes token in DB
* `POST /api/refresh` — validates refresh token and issues a new access token

All cookies are:

* `HttpOnly`
* `Secure`
* `SameSite=None`

> ✅ Compatible with cross-site frontends like `https://taday.io`

## 🧩 Frontend Integration

The frontend is hosted on [`https://taday.io`](https://taday.io). It communicates with this API by including credentials in fetch calls:

```ts
fetch("https://taday-api.fly.dev/api/users", {
  method: "GET",
  credentials: "include",
});
```

This ensures cookies (access & refresh tokens) are sent and handled securely across domains.

---
## 💵 Stripe Integration

Taday API is integrated with Stripe to manage subscription billing for premium plans. The integration includes:
* **Creating Customers:** A Stripe customer is created when a user initiates the checkout process if one doesn't already exist.
* **Checkout Sessions:** The /api/checkout endpoint returns a Stripe Checkout session URL that users can visit to subscribe.
* **Webhooks:** The /api/webhook endpoint listens for Stripe webhook events like customer.subscription.created, updated, and deleted. Subscription state changes are synchronized with the internal database.
* **Automatic Tax:** The integration supports Stripe's automatic tax calculation, capturing and storing customer address data via Checkout.
* **Cancel Subscriptions:** An endpoint is available to cancel a subscription by setting cancel_at_period_end to true.

## ⚙️ Setup (Dev)

1. **Start PostgreSQL** (or use a Fly.io volume)
2. **Run migrations** with `sqlc`
3. **Set up environment variables** (e.g., database URL, Stripe keys, Twilio credentials).
4. **Build the Go server**

```bash
go run ./cmd/api
```

---

## 📦 Deployment

App is deployed to Fly.io using Docker. On login, cookies are set with production flags:

* `Secure: true`
* `SameSite=None`
* `HttpOnly: true`

TLS termination is handled by Fly.io.
